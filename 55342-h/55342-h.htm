      FOREWORD
    </h2>
    <p>
      |T<i>HESE are plain tales of picturesque character-phases in Maine
      Yankeedom from the Allegash to the ocean. These are the men whose hands
      are blistered by plow-handle and ax, or whose calloused palms are gouged
      by the trawls. Their heads are as hard as the stones piled around their
      acres. Their wit is as keen as the bush-scythes with which they trim their
      rough pastures. But their hearts are as soft as the feather beds in their
      spare-rooms. </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      The frontispiece to this volume is from a photograph of &ldquo;Uncle Solon&rdquo;
       Chase, the widely known sage of Chase&rsquo;s Mills in Andros-coggin county.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Greenback days he won national fame as &ldquo;Them Steers&rdquo; and his quaint
      sayings have traveled from the Atlantic to the Pacific. There is no man in
      Maine who better typifies the homespun humor, honesty, and intelligence of
      Yankeedom. The picture opposite page 126 is from a photograph of the late
      Ezra Stephens of Oxford county, famed years ago as &ldquo;the P. T. Barnum of
      Maine.&rdquo; He originated the dancing turkey, the wonderful bird that appears
      in the story of &ldquo;Ozy B. Orr.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In another picture is shown &ldquo;Jemimy&rdquo; at her old loom and beside her are
      the swifts and the spinning wheel. The pictures illustrating &ldquo;Elkanah B.
      Atkinson&rdquo; (a poem commemorating a real episode in the life of Barney
      McGonldrick of Cherry field Tavern) and &ldquo;John W. Jones&rdquo; are character
      studies that will appeal to those who are acquainted with Maine rural
      life.

    <p class="indent15">
      And never was jest too broad for him&mdash;for all

    <p class="indent20">
      of the quip and chaff
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      That assailed his queer old mug through life

    <p class="indent20">
      he had but a hearty laugh.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;Ho, ho&rdquo;, he&rsquo;d snort, &ldquo;haw, haw&rdquo;, he&rsquo;d roar;

    <p class="indent20">
      that ever ye chanced to see?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And then he would tell us this little tale.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;&rsquo;Twas one dark night&rdquo;, said he,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;I was driving along in a piece of woods and
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      there wasn&rsquo;t a ray to see,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And all to once my cart locked wheels with
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      another old chap&rsquo;s cart;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      We gee-ed and backed but we hung there fast,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      and neither of us could start.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Then the stranger man he struck a match, to
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      see how he&rsquo;d git away,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And I vum, he had the homeliest face I&rsquo;ve seen
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      for many a day.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Wal, jest for a joke I grabbed his throat and
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      pulled my pipe-case out,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And the stranger reckoned I had a gun, and he
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      wrassled good and stout.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      But I got him down on his back at last and
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      straddled acrost his chest,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And allowed to him that he&rsquo;d better plan to
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      go to his last long rest.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      He gasped and groaned he was poor and old
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      and hadn&rsquo;t a blessed cent,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And almost blubbering asked to know what
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      under the sun I meant.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Said I, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve sworn if I meet a man that&rsquo;s
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      homelier &rsquo;n what I be,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      I&rsquo;ll kill him. I reckin I&rsquo;ve got the man.&rsquo; Says
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      he, &lsquo;Please let me see?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      So I loosened a bit while he struck a match;
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      he held it with trembling hand
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      While through the tears in his poor old eyes
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      my cross-piled face he scanned.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Then he dropped the match and he groaned
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      and said, &lsquo;If truly ye think that I
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Am ha&rsquo;f as homely as what you be&mdash;please
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      shoot! I want to die.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And the story always would start the laugh
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      and Jones would drop his jaw,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And lean&rsquo;way back and slap his leg and
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      laugh,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;Ho, haw&mdash;haw&mdash;haw-w-w!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p class="indent30">
      That was Jones,
    </p>
    <p class="indent30">
      &mdash;John W. Jones,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Queer, Gothic old structure of cob-piled bones;
    </p>
    <p class="indent30">
      His droll, red face
    </p>
    <p class="indent30">
      Had not a trace
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Of comeliness or of special grace;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      But I tell you, friends, that candor glowed
    </p>
    <p class="indent30">
      In those true old eyes&mdash;those deep old
    </p>
    <p class="indent30">
      eyes,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And love and faith and manhood showed
    </p>
    <p class="indent30">
      Without disguise&mdash;without disguise.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Though he certainly won a just renown
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      As the homeliest man we had in town.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      He never had married&mdash;that old John Jones;
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      he&rsquo;d grubbed on his little patch,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Supported his parents until they died, and then
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      he had lived &ldquo;old bach&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      We had some suspicions we couldn&rsquo;t prove:
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      for years had an unknown man
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Distributed gifts to the poor in town on a sort
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      of a Santa Claus plan.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      If a worthy old widow was needing wood&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      some night would that wood be left,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      There was garden truck placed in the barns of
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      those by mishap or drought bereft.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And once when the night was clear and bright
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      in the glorious month of June,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Poor broken-legged Johnson&rsquo;s garden was
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      hoed in the light of the great white moon.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And often some farmer by sickness weighed,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      and weary, discouraged and poor,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Would find a wad of worn old bills tucked

    <p class="indent20">
      carefully under his door.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And the tracks in the sod of this man who trod
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      by night on his secret routes
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Were suspiciously like the other tracks that
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      were left by John Jones&rsquo; boots.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And the wheel-marks wobbled extremely like
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      the trail of Jones&rsquo; old cart,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      But whatever his mercies he hid them all in the
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      depths of his warm old heart.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      For whenever the neighbors would pin him
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      down, he&rsquo;d lift his faded hat,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;Now, say&rdquo;, he&rsquo;d laugh, &ldquo;can a man be good
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      with a physog such as that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Then came the days&mdash;the black, dread days
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      when the small-pox swept our town,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      With pest-house crowded from sill to eaves and
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      the nurses &ldquo;taken down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And panic reigned and the best went wild and
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      even the doctors fled,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And scarce was there one to aid the sick or
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      bury the awful dead.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      But there in that pest house day and night a
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      man with quiet tones
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And steady heart kept still at work&mdash;and that
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      was old John Jones.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      While ever his joke was, &ldquo;What! Afraid?
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Why, gracious me, I&rsquo;m fine,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And if I weren&rsquo;t, a few more dents won&rsquo;t harm
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      this face of mine&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      But those who writhed and moaned in pain
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      within that loathsome place
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Saw beauty not of man and earth upon that
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      gnarled old face.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And when he eased their pain-racked forms or
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      brought the cooling draught,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      They wondered if this saint could be the man
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      at whom they&rsquo;d laughed.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And thus he fought, unwearied, brave, until
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      the Terror passed,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &mdash;And then, poor old John W. Jones, he had
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      the small-pox last.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And worn by vigils, toil, and fast, the fate he
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      had defied
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Descended on him, stern and fierce,&mdash;he died,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      my friends, he died.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      They held one service at the church for all the
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      village dead.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      The pastor, when he came to Jones, he choked
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      a bit and said:
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;If handsome is as handsome does&mdash;and now
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      I say to you
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      I verily&mdash;I honestly believe that saying true.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &mdash;If handsome is as handsome does, we had

    <p class="indent20">
      right here in town

    <p class="indent15">
      A man whose beauty fairly shone&mdash;from

    <p class="indent15">
      Heaven itself brought down.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      At first, perhaps, we failed to grasp the con-

    <p class="indent20">
      tour of that face,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      But now with God&rsquo;s own light on it we see its
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">

    <p class="indent15">

    <p class="indent15">
      With streaming eyes looked up and said, &ldquo;was

      Of comeliness or of special grace.

      Wrought at the sheet with a rasping pen;

    <p class="indent15">

      &ldquo;Thanksgivin&rsquo; Jim&rdquo;.

    <p class="indent20">
      He was little&mdash;why,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t scarce knee high
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      To a garden toad. But was mighty spry!
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      He was all of a whew
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      If he&rsquo;d things to do!
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      &rsquo;Twas a zip and a streak when Jim went
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      through.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      But his voice was twice as big as him
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And the boys all called him &ldquo;Squealin&rsquo; Jim&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      He was always a-hurryin&rsquo; all through his life
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And said there wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t time for to hunt up a
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      wife.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      So he kept bach&rsquo;s hall and he worked like a

    <p class="indent20">
      dog,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &mdash;Jest whooped right along at a trottin&rsquo; hoss

    <p class="indent20">
      jog-
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      There&rsquo;s a yarn that the fellers that knew him
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      will tell
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      If they want to set Jim out and set him out
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      well:
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      He was bound for the city on bus&rsquo;ness one day
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And whoosh! scooted down to the depot, they
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      say.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      The depot-man says, &ldquo;Hain&rsquo;t no rush, Mr.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Waite,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      For the train to the city is ten minutes late
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Off flew Squealin&rsquo; Jim with his grip, on the
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      run,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And away down the track he went hoofin&rsquo; like
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      fun.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      When he tore out of sight, couldn&rsquo;t see him
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      for dust
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And he squealed, &ldquo;Train be jiggered! I&rsquo;ll git
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      there, now, fust!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &mdash;So nervous and active he jest wouldn&rsquo;t wait
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      When they told him the train was a leetle dite
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      late.
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Now that was Jim!
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      He was stubby and slim
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      But it took a spry critter to step up with him.
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      His height when he&rsquo;d rise
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Made ye laugh, but his eyes
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Let ye know that his soul wasn&rsquo;t much under-
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      size.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And some old widders we had in town
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Insisted, reg&rsquo;lar, he wore a crown.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      As he whoopity-larruped along on his way,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      There were people who&rsquo;d turn up their noses
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      and say
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      That Squealin&rsquo; Jim Waite wasn&rsquo;t right in his
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      head;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      He was cranky as blazes, the old growlers said.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      I can well understand that some things he
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      would do
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Seemed loony as time to that stingy old crew.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      For a fact, there was no one jest like him in
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      town,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      He was most always actin&rsquo; the part of a clown;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      He would say funny things in his queer,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      squealin&rsquo; style,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And he talked so&rsquo;s you&rsquo;d hear him for more
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      than a mile.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      But ev&rsquo;ry Thanksgivin&rsquo; time Waite he would
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      start
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And clatter through town in his rattlin&rsquo; old
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      cart,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And what do ye s&rsquo;pose? He would whang
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      down the street,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Yank up at each widder&rsquo;s; from under the seat
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Would haul out a turkey of yaller-legged chick
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And holler, &ldquo;Here, mother, h&rsquo;ist out with ye,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      quick!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Then he&rsquo;d toss down a bouncer right into her
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      lap
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And belt off like fury with, &ldquo;G&rsquo;long, there!
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Gid dap!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Didn&rsquo;t wait for no thanks&mdash;couldn&rsquo;t work &rsquo;em
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      on him,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &mdash;Couldn&rsquo;t catch him to thank him&mdash;that
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Thanksgivin&rsquo; Jim.
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      &rsquo;Twas a queer idee
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      &rsquo;Round town that he
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Was off&rsquo;n his balance and crazy&rsquo;s could be.
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      They&rsquo;d set and chaw
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      And stew and jaw,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And projick on what he did it for.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      But prob&rsquo;ly in Heaven old Squealin&rsquo; Jim

      of long ago

    <p class="indent15">
      When &ldquo;bound-out&rdquo; children trudged to school

      Now you&rsquo;ll find them, grown to manhood,

    <p class="indent15">
      All the makeshifts and privations of these

      Who daily tread the up-turned soil on rough

      labor won,

      To all of these who seek no crown I bring my

      wreath of bay

    <p class="indent15">
      And set it on their sun-tanned brows and on

    <p class="indent20">
      their locks of gray, &lsquo;

    <p class="indent15">

      kitchen chair,

      He would clutch the rungs and bow his head

    <p class="indent20">
      and pray his bed-time prayer.

      cut near horn or hoof;

      Whenever he mumbled his simple prayer in

      the kitchen by his chair,

      Aunt Rich would rattle the supper pans and

      She&rsquo;d never &ldquo;professed,&rdquo; as the saying is, she

    <p class="indent15">
      Elias fought the wolf of want as best he might

    <p class="indent20">
      with his axe;

      He even aided with scanty store some desolate

    <p class="indent15">
      Tom or Jim,

    <p class="indent15">
      But at last when his poor old arms gave out no

    <p class="indent20">
      hands were reached to him.

    <p class="indent15">
      Folks said that a man who was paralyzed re-

    <p class="indent20">
      quired some special care,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And allowed that the poor farm was the place;
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      so they carried the old folks there.

    <p class="indent15">
      &rsquo;Twas a heavy cross for Elias&rsquo; wife but Elias

    <p class="indent20">
      ne&rsquo;er complained,

    <p class="indent15">
      To all of her frettings he made reply: &ldquo;When

    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      They were dreary years that Elias lived, one
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      half of his body dead,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      He sat in his cold, bare, town-farm room and
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      patiently spelled and read
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      The promise his old black Bible gave, and then
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      he&rsquo;d lift his eyes
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And look right up through the dingy walls to
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      his mansion in the skies.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      They mockingly called him &ldquo;Heavenly
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Crown&rdquo; when he talked of his faith, but he
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Smiled sweetly ever and meekly said, &ldquo;I know
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      what I can see!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      When he died at last and the parson preached
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      above the stained, pine box,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      He said, &ldquo;Perhaps this simple faith was a bit
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      too orthodox;

    <p class="indent15">
      Perhaps allowance should be made for the
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      metaphors divine
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And yet, my friends, I&rsquo;ll not presume to make
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      such province mine.

    <p class="indent15">
      Though in that Book the highest thought can
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      find transcendent food,

      &rsquo;Tis primer, too, for the poor and plain, the
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      unlearned and the rude.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And so I say no man to-day should seek to tear
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      it down,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Nor flout the homely, honest soul that claims

    <p class="indent20">
      its golden crown.&rdquo;

    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Friends placed above Elias&rsquo; grave a plain,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      white marble stone,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And months went by. Then all at once &rsquo;twas
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      seen that there had grown

    <p class="indent15">
      Upon the polished marble slab a shading that,

      Took on a shape extremely like Elias&rsquo; shaggy-

    <p class="indent20">
      head.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Then soon above the shadowy brows a crown
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      was slowly limned,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And though Aunt Rich scrubbed zealously the

    <p class="indent20">
      thing could not be dimmed.

    <p>
      <br />

      But now, the neighbors all averred, Elias

      scrubbed and rubbed by day,

      OLD &ldquo;FIGGER-FOUR&rdquo;
     </h2>
    <p class="indent15">
      He played when summer sunsets glowed and
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      twilight deepened down,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      His shrilling flute throbbed out and out in the
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      ears of the little town;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      When the chores were done and his cattle fed
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      and the old horse munched his oats,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      He took his flute to his racked old porch and
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      chirped his wavering notes.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And far and wide on the evening breeze from
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      the old house on the hill,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Went trinkling off the thin, long strains, like
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      the cry of the whip-poor-will.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And the women paused with the supper things
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      and harkened at the door,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And to the questioning stranger said, &ldquo;Why,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      that&rsquo;s old Figger-Four.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      He bobbed to his work in his little field and
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      tidied his lonesome home;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      He&rsquo;d the light of peace in his quiet face, though
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      his shape was that of a gnome.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      One knee was angled, hooked and stiff, the
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      mark of a fever sore,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And the saucy wits of the countryside had
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      dubbed him &ldquo;Figger-Four.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Yet those who knew him never thought of the
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      twist in the poor, bent limb,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And only strangers had a smile for the name
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      bestowed on him.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      For if ever a man was a neighbor true, that
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      man, my friend, was he,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And the name he bore of &ldquo;Figger-Four&rdquo; was
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      our symbol of constancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &rsquo;Twas he who came to the stricken homes and
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      closed the dead men&rsquo;s eyes;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &rsquo;Twas he who watched by the poor men&rsquo;s biers
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      with a care no money buys;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &rsquo;Twas he who sat by the fretful sick, and ne&rsquo;er
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      could rash complaint
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Disturb the placid soul and smile of the gnarled
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      old village saint.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And all came straight from out his heart, for
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      when one spoke of pay,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      He simply smiled a wistful smile and said:
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      &ldquo;That ain&rsquo;t my way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      A glistening eye was prized by him above a
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      golden store;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      An. earnest clasp of neighbor&rsquo;s hand paid every
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      debt and more.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And when there was no call for him from Tom,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      or Dick or Jim,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      He took his lip-stained flute and played a good
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      old gospel hymn.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      So, when the placid, sunset skies were banked
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      above the town,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      To every home and every ear those notes came
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      softly down.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And truly, friend, it used to seem the good old
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      man would play,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      As if, for lack of else to do, to pipe our cares
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      away.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And tongues were hushed and heads were bent,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      and angry home dispute
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Gave way to silence, then to smiles, when
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      &ldquo;Figger-Four&rsquo;s&rdquo; old flute
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Sent down its long-drawn, mild reproach from
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      off the little hill&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Expostulation in its notes, a pleading in its
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      thrill.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And somehow, though the hearts were hot and
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      tongues were stirring fray,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Those dripping tones came down like balm and
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      cooled the wrath away.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      He&rsquo;d lived his lesson in our gaze; he was not
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      one who talked;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      His life was straight, although, alas, he bobbed
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      so when he walked!
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And though we&rsquo;ve lost our richest men, we

    <p class="indent20">
      mourn far more, far more,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">

      That was the make-up of Aunt Phebe Pratt.

    <p class="indent15">
      Lawyer True looked kind o&rsquo; doubtful when

      they told him what was on.

      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll admit,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that no one&rsquo;s got a

    <p class="indent15">
      I have seen so many cases&mdash;heard &rsquo;em tried

    <p class="indent15">
      Uncle Tascus, though, insisted. He was allus

      He allowed he&rsquo;d show the neighbors jest the

    <p class="indent15">
      Wal, s&rsquo;r, Uncle Tascus pondered, pondered,

      pondered all that day.

    <p class="indent15">
      An&rsquo; that evenin&rsquo; still was pond&rsquo;rin&rsquo;, as he

    <p class="indent15">
      John he set dus&rsquo; up t&rsquo; table, underneath the

    <p class="indent15">
      Then he folded it an&rsquo; chuckled. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all

    <p class="indent20">
      right an&rsquo; tight,&rdquo; he said,

      Read it over very careful. Then says he, &ldquo;My

    <p class="indent20">
      leave each gent his own&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      If ye note as ye pass he&rsquo;s havin&rsquo; a cinch, stand
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      off an&rsquo; leave him alone.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      But you&rsquo;ve slobbered along where you don&rsquo;t
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      belong, an&rsquo; you&rsquo;ve gone an&rsquo; spiled the thing,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      An&rsquo; now, by the pink-tailed Wah-hoo-fish,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      you&rsquo;ll take your dose, by jing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      So, actin&rsquo; by orders, the cook fetched up our
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      biggest knife on board,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      An&rsquo; he ripped that shark in his &rsquo;midship bulge;
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      then the Old Man he explored.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      An&rsquo; after a while, with a nasty smile, he giv&rsquo; a
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      yank an&rsquo; twist,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;Hurroo!&rdquo; yells he, an&rsquo; then we see the liver
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      clinched in his fist.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Still actin&rsquo; by orders, the cook fetched out his
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      needle an&rsquo; biggest twine&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      With a herrin&rsquo;-bone stitch sewed up that shark,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      all right an&rsquo; tight an&rsquo; fine.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      We throwed him back with a mighty smack,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      an&rsquo; the look as he swum away
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Was the most reproachfulest kind of a look
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      I&rsquo;ve seen for many a day.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      An&rsquo; the liver was throwed in the scuttle-butt,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      to keep it all fresh an&rsquo; cool,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Then we up with our sheet an&rsquo; off we beat,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      a-chasin&rsquo; that mackerel school.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      We sailed all day in a criss-cross way, but the
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      school it skipped an&rsquo; skived,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      It dodged an&rsquo; ducked, an&rsquo; backed an&rsquo; bucked,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      an&rsquo; scooted an&rsquo; swum an&rsquo; dived.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      An&rsquo; we couldn&rsquo;t catch &rsquo;em, the best we&rsquo;d do&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      an&rsquo; oh, how the Old Man swore!
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      He went an&rsquo; he gargled his throat in ile, &rsquo;twas
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      peeled so raw an&rsquo; sore.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      But at last, &rsquo;way off at the edge of the sea, we
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      suddenly chanced to spy
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      A tall back-fin come fannin&rsquo; in, ag&rsquo;inst the sun-
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      set sky.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      An&rsquo; the sea ahead of it shivered an&rsquo; gleamed
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      with a shiftin&rsquo; an&rsquo; silvery hue,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      With here a splash an&rsquo; there a dash, an&rsquo; a rip-
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      ple shootin&rsquo; through.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      An&rsquo; the Old Man jumped six feet from deck;
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      he hollered an&rsquo; says, says he:
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;Here comes the biggest mackerel school since
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      the Lord set off the sea!
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      An&rsquo; right behind, if I hain&rsquo;t blind, by the prong-
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      jawed dog-fish&rsquo;s bark,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Is a finnin&rsquo; that mis&rsquo;able hog of the sea, that
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      liverless, shag-eyed shark!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      But we out with our bait an&rsquo; down with our
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      hooks, an&rsquo; we fished an&rsquo; fished an&rsquo; fished,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      While &rsquo;round in a circle, a-cuttin&rsquo; the sea, that
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      back-fin whished an&rsquo; slished;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      An&rsquo; we noticed at last he was herdin&rsquo; the school
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      an&rsquo; drivin&rsquo; &rsquo;em on our bait,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      An&rsquo; they bit an&rsquo; they bit an&rsquo; we pulled &rsquo;em in at
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      a reg&rsquo;lar wholesale rate.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      We pulled &rsquo;em in till the S&rsquo;airey Ann was wal-
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      lerin&rsquo; with her load,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      An&rsquo; we stopped at last&rsquo;cause there wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t no
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      room for the mackerel to be stowed.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Then up came a-finnin&rsquo; that liverless shark, an&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      he showed his stitched-up side,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      An&rsquo; the look in his eyes was such a look that
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      the Old Man fairly cried.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      We rigged a tackle an&rsquo; lowered a noose an&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      the shark stuck up his neck,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Then long an&rsquo; slow, with a heave yo-ho, we
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      h&rsquo;isted him up on deck.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      The skipper he blubbered an&rsquo; grabbed a fin an&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      gave it a hearty shake;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Says he, &ldquo;Old man, don&rsquo;t lay it up an&rsquo; we&rsquo;ll
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      have a drop to take.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      An&rsquo;, actin&rsquo; by orders, the cook fetched up our
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      kag of good old rum;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      The shark he had his drink poured first, an&rsquo; all
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      of us then took some.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Still actin&rsquo; by orders, the cook he took an&rsquo; he
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      picked them stitches out,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      An&rsquo; we all turned to, an&rsquo; we lent a hand;
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      though of course we had some doubt
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      As to how he&rsquo;d worn it an&rsquo; how&rsquo;twas hitched,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      an&rsquo; whuther&rsquo;twas tight or slack,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      But as best we could&mdash;as we understood&mdash;we
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      put that liver back.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Then we sewed him up, an&rsquo; we shook his fin
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      an&rsquo; we giv&rsquo; him another drink,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      We h&rsquo;isted him over the rail ag&rsquo;in an&rsquo; he giv&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      us a partin&rsquo; wink.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Then he swum away, an&rsquo; I dast to say, although
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      he was rather sore,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      He felt that he&rsquo;d started the trouble first, an&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      we&rsquo;d done our best an&rsquo; more.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &rsquo;Cause a dozen times&rsquo;fore the season closed
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      an&rsquo; the mackerel skipped to sea,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      He herded a school an&rsquo; drove &rsquo;em in, as gen-
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      tlemanlike as could be.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      We&rsquo;d toss him a drink, an&rsquo; he&rsquo;d tip a wink, as
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      sociable as ye please,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      No kinder nor better-mannered shark has ever

    <p class="indent20">
      swum the seas.

    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Now, the moral is, if you cut a friend before
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      that you know he&rsquo;s friend,

    <p class="indent15">

    <p class="indent15">

    <p class="indent20">
      this for a shark.

    <p class="indent20">
      up,

      cup.

      quick

      And juggled me neat as could be;

      As ever ye saw on the sea.

    <p class="indent15">
      At first I was skittish, as you can see why,

    <p class="indent15">

      We heard her a mile to west&rsquo;ard&mdash;the liner that

      cut us through&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      As crushing the fog at a twenty-jog she drove

      than&rsquo;s growl of wrath.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      We could tell she was aimed to smash us, so
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      we clashed at our little bell,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      But the sound was shredded by screaming wind

    <p class="indent20">
      and we simply rung our knell.

    <p class="indent15">
      And the feeble breath, that screamed at Death

    <p class="indent15">
      Her green and her red glared overhead and her

    <p class="indent20">
      bows were spouting yeast.

    <p class="indent15">
      The eyes of her reddened hawse-holes, her

    <p class="indent15">
      She scornfully spurned us under, the while her

    <p class="indent15">
      Nor heeded the crash of our little craft nor the

    <p class="indent20">

    <p class="indent20">
      the thud and thrill.

    <p class="indent15">

    <p class="indent15">
      There was never a whine nor whimper, only
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      some muttered groans,

    <p class="indent15">
      As the ocean buffeted martyrs who clung there

      with shattered bones,

    <p class="indent15">
      And those whose grip was broken as the surge

    <p class="indent20">
      reeled creaming high,

    <p class="indent15">
      Went out from the ken of the searchlight with

    <p class="indent20">
      a hoarse but brave &ldquo;Good-by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p class="indent15">

      they deem that he ought to live.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      For there in the searchlight&rsquo;s glory, the night

    <p class="indent20">
      that they cut us down,

    <p class="indent15">
      Old Injun Joe gave up his cask that another

    <p class="indent15">
      Old Joe was a lone world-rover, the other had

    <p class="indent15">
      No word was said, but Joe went down with a

      wave of his dripping hand.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And ere the lifeboats reached us and gathered

    <p class="indent20">
      our scattered few,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      We saw that night what so long we&rsquo;d known,

      that a Glo&rsquo;ster fishing crew,

    <p class="indent15">
      Rude and rough and grimed and gruff, had

    <p class="indent20">

    <p class="indent15">
      That on sea or sod they can meet their God in

    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Then over her sullen bulwarks, as she stamped

    <p class="indent20">
      and chafed and rolled,

    <p class="indent15">
      From the night and wreck to her dazzling deck

    <p class="indent20">
      climbed we&mdash;and our tale was told.

    <p class="indent15">
      And the dainty folk from her staterooms lis-

    <p class="indent20">
      tened and gazed and said,

      As they tiptoed across our dripping trail,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      &ldquo;How awful!&rdquo;&mdash;then went to bed.

    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      our scattered few came back.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And haughtily unrepentant, the liner, insolent
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      still,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Through foam and spume and fog and gloom
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      drove on to wreak her will.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Were only her zeal less eager, her lust for her
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      prey less keen,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      She must have sensed that horrid chill that
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      shuddered from One Unseen.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      But onward she plunged unheeding that there
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      in the vast, black sea,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      As grim as Fate there lay in wait One mightier

    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And she crushed herself like dead-ripe fruit

    <p class="indent20">
      against the iceberg&rsquo;s wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />

      that maddened crowd.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      There were men in silken night-gear who

      fought frail women back,

    <p class="indent15">
      There were pampered fools who, fierce as

      ghouls, left murder in their track;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      There were shrieking men whose jeweled
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      hands dragged children from a boat
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And rode away in the babies&rsquo; stead when the

    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &rsquo;Tis not for boast that I tell the rest: we&rsquo;re

      not of the boasting kind&mdash;

      A man who sneers at a tattered coat or a sun-

    <p class="indent20">
      burned fist or face,

    <p class="indent15">
      And believes that only blood or purse can

      honor the human race.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Forlorn and few, our battered crew had stared

    <p class="indent20">
      at Death that night;

    <p class="indent15">
      Perhaps we&rsquo;d known him so long and well his
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      mien did not affright.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Perhaps we hide here in our hearts, below the

      rags and tan,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      The honest stuff, unplaned and rough, that
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      really makes the man.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      For we bared our arms and we stormed the

    <p class="indent20">
      press&mdash;of safety took no care;

    <p class="indent15">
      We dragged those wretches from the boats&mdash;

    <p class="indent20">
      then placed the women there.

      Then the ragged coats of those Glo&rsquo;ster men

      THE BALLAD OF ORASMUS NUTE
    </h2>
    <p class="indent15">
      There once was a Quaker, Orasmus Nute,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      With a physog as stiff as a cowhide boot,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And he skippered a ship from Georgetown, Maine,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      In the&rsquo;way-back days of the pirates&rsquo; reign.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And the story I tell it has to do
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      With Orasmus Nute and a black flag crew;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      The tale of the upright course he went
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      In the face of a certain predicament.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      For Orasmus Nute was a godly man
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And he faithfully followed the Quaker plan
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Of love for all and a peaceful life
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And a horror of warfare and bloody strife.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      While above the honors of seas and fleets
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      He prized his place on &ldquo;the facing seats.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Ah, Orasmus Nute,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Orasmus Nute,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      He never disgraced his plain drab suit.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Now often he sailed for spice and teas
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &rsquo;Way off some place through the Barbary seas;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And once for a venture his good ship bore
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Some unhung grindstones, a score or more.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Now, never in all of his trips till then
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Had he spoken those godless pirate men.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      But it chanced one day near a foreign shore
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      The sail of a strange craft toward him bore;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And as soon as the rig was clearly seen
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      The mate allowed&rsquo;twas a black lateen.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Now a black lateen, as all men knew,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Was the badge of a bold, bad pirate crew.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      So the mate he crammed to its rusty neck
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      A grim &ldquo;Long Tom&rdquo; on the quarter deck,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Then leaned on its muzzle a bit to pray
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And waited to hear what the skipper would say.
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      For Orasmus Nute,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Orasmus Nute
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Had stepped below for to change his suit.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      He asked as he came on deck again,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;Does thee really think those are pirate men?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;Yea, verily,&rdquo; answered the Quaker mate,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;And they come at a most unseemly gait.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Orasmus Nute looked over the rail
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      At the bulging sweep of the huge black sail;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Said he, &ldquo;We are keeping our own straight
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      path,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And I&rsquo;m sorry to harm those men of wrath
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Yet, brother, perchance we are justified
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      In letting Thomas rebuke their pride.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      We&rsquo;ll simply give &rsquo;em a dash of fright.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      So be sure, my friend, thee have aimed just
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      He squinted his eye along the rust,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;Now shoot,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;if thee thinks thee
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      must.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Ker-boomo! the old Long Thomas roared,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And the big lateen flopped overboard.
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      And Orasmus Nute,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Orasmus Nute,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Seemed puzzled to find that he could shoot.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;Now what are those sinful men about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      He asked, as he heard a hoarse, long shout.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And the Quaker mate he answered, &ldquo;Lo!
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      They&rsquo;ve out with their oars, and here they
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      row!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;Now, what in the name of William Penn,&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Cried Orasmus Nute, &ldquo;can ail those men?
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Perchance they are after our load of stones,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Will thee roll them up here, Brother Jones?
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      We&rsquo;ll save them all of the work we can&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      As a Quaker should for his fellow man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      So as soon as the fierce, black pirate drew
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Up&rsquo;longside, that Quaker crew
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Rolled those grindstones down pell-mell,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And every stone smashed through the shell
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Of the pirate zebec, and down it went,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And all of the rascals to doom were sent,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      While Orasmus Nute leaned over the side,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;No thanks, thee&rsquo;rt welcome, my friends,&rdquo; he
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      cried.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      It chanced one wretch from the sunken craft
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Made a clutch at a rope that was trailing aft,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And up he was swarming with frantic hope,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      When Orasmus cried, &ldquo;Does thee want that
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      rope? &rdquo;
     </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      So he cut it away with one swift hack
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      With a smile for the pirate as he dropped back.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And the Quaker skipper surveyed the sea
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;God loveth the generous man,&rdquo; quoth he.
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Then Orasmus Nute,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Orasmus Nute
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Went down and resumed his Quaker suit.

      A hand-line smack that cuffed the seas&rsquo;twixt

    <p class="indent15">
      They fished and ate and swapped their bait and

    <p class="indent20">
      always agreed on every point.

      Never a &ldquo;hitch&rdquo; more friendly than

    <p class="indent15">
      And never could anything break their bonds,

    <p class="indent20">
      each to the other would often swear.

    <p class="indent15">
      But alas, one day in a joking way they fell on

    <p class="indent20">
      the topic of years and age,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And tackled the subject of boughten teeth, and
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      spirited argument they did wage.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      For Dan insisted that sets of teeth were glued

    <p class="indent20">
      to the sides of the wearers&rsquo; jaws,

    <p class="indent15">
      &mdash;Never had seen &rsquo;em, he frankly owned, but

      he knew &rsquo;twas so, &ldquo;wal, jest because.&rdquo;

    <p class="indent15">
      While Dunk, with notions fully as firm, clawed
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      at his frosty whisker fringe,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And allowed that he knew that sets of teeth
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      were hitched together with spring and
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      hinge.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      So, still perverse, they argued on&mdash;the quarrel,

    <p class="indent20">
      you see, was their very first;

    <p class="indent15">
      &rsquo;Twas as though they had taken a sip of brine;

    <p class="indent20">
      thirst.

    <p class="indent15">
      They argued early and argued late and the dog

    <p class="indent20">
      surveyed them with wistful look
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      For, the more they talked the worse they
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      balked, and forgot to fish or eat or cook.

    <p>

    <p class="indent20">
      Dan at Dunk and Dunk at Dan,

     </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      With chalk he zoned the dingy deck and roared,

    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;Git for&rsquo;rard acrost that line!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      He lighted his pipe and twirled the wheel and
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      calmly then he crossed his knees.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;Go for&rsquo;rard,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;this end is mine an&rsquo;

      I&rsquo;ll steer jest where I gol-durn please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      For&rsquo;rard went Dan with never a word, never
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      protested, never demurred,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      But as soon as he reached the cat-head bolt the

    <p class="indent20">
      sound of hammer on steel was heard.

    <p class="indent15">

    <p class="indent20">
      fast to the bottom on Doghead shoal;

    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;The bow-end&rsquo;s mine,&rdquo; yelled Dan to Dunk,

    <p class="indent15">

    <p class="indent20">
      and roaring and frothing wild,

    <p class="indent15">
      Clawed them tinder, as there they rode, or a

    <p class="indent15">
      But known it is that for days and weeks the

    <p class="indent15">

    <p class="indent20">

      No one knows how they met their death, but

    <p class="indent20">
      certain it is that Dunk and Dan,

    <p class="indent15">
      Each decided he&rsquo;d rather die than surrender a

    <p class="indent20">
      cided he&rsquo;d sink his half,

    <p class="indent15">
      Or Dan touched match and burned his end,

    <p class="indent20">
      then went to death with a scornful laugh.

      An&rsquo; when we counted noses as we rounded

      Giant&rsquo;s Grist

    <p class="indent15">
      We found the chap among us on the Mary of

      the Mist.

    <p class="indent15">
      An&rsquo; we sized him for a &ldquo;conjer&rdquo; ere we&rsquo;d

    <p class="indent20">
      fairly got to sea;

    <p class="indent15">
      The wind was whiffin&rsquo; crooked, jest as mean as

      Then the skipper spied the P. I. fubbin&rsquo; secret

    <p class="indent20">
      at the mast,

    <p class="indent15">
      An&rsquo; at once he got suspicious an&rsquo; he overhauled

      him fast.

    <p class="indent15">
      The chap had made some markin&rsquo;s an&rsquo; he&rsquo;d

      driven in a nail&mdash;

      then was done&mdash;

      The gale came up a-roarin&rsquo; with the settin&rsquo; of

      the sun.

    <p class="indent15">
      Then we wallered to the west&rsquo;ard an&rsquo; we wal-

    <p class="indent20">
      lered to the east,

    <p class="indent15">

      wind an&rsquo; yeast.

    <p class="indent15">
      We smashed our way to suth&rsquo;ard, an&rsquo; we clawed

    <p class="indent20">
      an&rsquo; ratched to west,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      There was scarcely time for eatin&rsquo;; there was

    <p class="indent20">
      never chance for rest,

    <p class="indent15">
      With the liners slammin&rsquo; past us through the

    <p class="indent15">
      An&rsquo; the Mary dodgin&rsquo; passers like a puppy in a

    <p class="indent15">
      The third day found us flappin&rsquo; with a mighty

      The lee rail runnin&rsquo; under an&rsquo; the trawl tubs all

    <p class="indent20">
      a-swash,

    <p class="indent15">
      An&rsquo; at last the plummet told us we were backin&rsquo;

      to&rsquo;ards the shoals,

    <p class="indent15">

    <p class="indent15">
      Then up spoke Isaac Innis, with a starin&rsquo;,

    <p class="indent20">
      glarin&rsquo; glance,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      An&rsquo; he says: &ldquo;My friends, I&rsquo;m lookin&rsquo;

      where I look!

    <p class="indent15">
      I hain&rsquo;t a saint in no way, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll give a man a

    <p class="indent15">
      I reckon ye discern him,

      The stranger &ldquo;conjer&rdquo; sailor, that P. I.&mdash;

    <p class="indent15">
      He never flinched nor quivered, though we&rsquo;d

    <p class="indent20">
      reckoned that he would,

    <p class="indent15">
      He simply turned an&rsquo; faced us, an&rsquo; he says: &ldquo;I

      meant ye good.

    <p class="indent15">
      I asked a breeze from suth&rsquo;ard, but it slipped

    <p class="indent20">
      an&rsquo; got away;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Still, you needn&rsquo;t worry, shipmates! When I

    <p class="indent20">
      owe a debt I&rsquo;ll pay.&rdquo;

    <p class="indent15">
      He reeved a coil of hawser that the Mary car-

      care.

      He hitched a dagon-sinker an&rsquo; he let the line

    <p class="indent20">
      run free,

    <p class="indent15">
      An&rsquo; overboard he fired it, kersplasho, in the

    <p class="indent20">
      sea,

    <p class="indent15">
      We didn&rsquo;t get the language of the secret spells

    <p class="indent15">
      We heard him as he muttered an&rsquo; it seemed

      What kind of fish was bitin&rsquo;, with an eyesight

      And the sky seemed splittin&rsquo; open for to let
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      our vessel through;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      When we wallowed down wher-rooshin&rsquo; in the
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      gulf that gawped beneath,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      We&rsquo;d&rsquo;a&rsquo; left our hearts behind us if we hadn&rsquo;t
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      clinched our teeth.
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      We&rsquo;d really seem to feel
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Old Hankses&rsquo; battered keel
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Go bumpin&rsquo; on the bottom when she made her
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      downward reel.
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      But the more she blew and blew,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Old Jason cheered his crew,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &mdash;His whiskers whipping snappin&rsquo; as the wind
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      went screamin&rsquo; through.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      So we hung to brace and riggin&rsquo; and we let her
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      roar and roll,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      While each man pinned to Ellison the safety of
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      his soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Then at last we knew&rsquo;twas night-time by the

    <p class="indent20">
      thick&rsquo;nin&rsquo; overhead,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And Jason licked his taster and he yelled:
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;Now throw the lead!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      An&rsquo; we&mdash;we blinked to watch him from the
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      darkness where we clung,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And waited for the verdict, of that long and
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      peak-ed tongue.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      He tasted&mdash;then he waited, and he smacked his
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      lips a spell,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      He tasted&mdash;tasted&mdash;tasted, then he gave an
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      awful yell:
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      &ldquo;My God, ye critters, pray!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      &mdash;He slung the lead away,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And howled: &ldquo;The world is endin&rsquo;! It&rsquo;s the
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      final Judgment Day!
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      That plummet, there, has brought us up a hand-
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      ful of the loam
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      From the Widder Abbott&rsquo;s garden on the Neck
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      ro&rsquo;d, back at home.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      A tidal wave has lifted us&mdash;the Hanks has run

    <p class="indent20">
      away!
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      &mdash;It has tossed&rsquo;er over Glo&rsquo;ster,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      And we sartin sure have lost&rsquo;er,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &rsquo;Less ye pray, ye sin-struck critters,&rsquo;less ye
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      pray, pray, pray!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Each clung to rope and stanchion, each hung to
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      stay and brace,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Each prayed up at the heavens while the spin-
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      drift lashed his face;
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      We prayed and prayed till mornin&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Till the early, yaller dawnin&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Lit up the sea around us, and it also lit our
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      case;
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Then we found an explanation
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Of the sing&rsquo;lar situation
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      That was figgered in the darkness of the night
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      by Uncle Jase.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      For we noticed there was settin&rsquo; up against the
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      le&rsquo;ward rail
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Some lavender and other yarbs, a-growin&rsquo; in a
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      pail.
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      &mdash;They&rsquo;d been brought aboard by Jase
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Who had worn a meechin&rsquo; face,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      For his sparkin&rsquo; of the widder was the gossip
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      of the place.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      He knowed a flower-garden looked peecooliar
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      on the Hanks,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      But he wanted some momentum of the widder
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      on the Banks.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Now, the plummet bein&rsquo; handled in the dark-
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      ness of that night
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Somehow cuffed that dirt in passin&rsquo;&mdash;as ye
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      might say, took a bite.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And Jason knew the flavor of that scrimp of
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      garden loam,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &mdash;There wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t a soil to fool him&rsquo;twixt Quero
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Shoal and home.
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      By the flavor and the feel
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      He could tell us off the reel,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      The name of any bottom that was underneath
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      our keel.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      He was only once mistaken in the memory of
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      men,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And his crew will keep insistin&rsquo; that he wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      mistaken then.

    <p class="indent20">
      had passed the flume,

    <p class="indent15">

    <p class="indent15">

    <p class="indent20">
      enough and room,

    <p class="indent15">
      Arranged a Christmas function and invited

      Murphy&rsquo;s crew.

      The folks at Rapo-genus hired Ezra Hewson&rsquo;s

    <p class="indent15">
      Now Murphy&rsquo;s crew was willing and they

    <p class="indent20">
      walked the fifteen miles,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And arrived at Rapo-genus wearing most be-

    <p class="indent20">
      nignant smiles.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      The genial floor director waited near the outer

    <p class="indent20">
      door,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And pleasantly suggested they remove the
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      boots they wore.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      He said that Rapo-genus wished to make of

    <p class="indent20">
      this affair
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      An elegant occasion, &ldquo;reshershay and day-

    <p class="indent20">
      bonair;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      So it seemed the town&rsquo;s opinion, after many
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      long disputes,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      That&rsquo;twas time to change the custom and ex-

    <p class="indent20">
      clude the spike-sole boots.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      He owned&rsquo;twas rather drastic and would cause
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      a social jar
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &rsquo;Twixt Upper Ambejejus and the Twin Deps-

    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;But &rsquo;tis settled,&rdquo; so he told them, &ldquo;that nary

      wearin&rsquo; spikes.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      So I asks ye very kindly, but I asks ye one and

    <p class="indent20">
      all,

    <p class="indent15">
      To leave your brogan calkers on the outside of

      this hall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;This &rsquo;ere is sort o&rsquo; sudden,&rdquo; said the boss of
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Murphy&rsquo;s crew,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;Jest excuse us for a minute, but we don&rsquo;t
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      know what to do.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      We&rsquo;ve attended social functions at the Upper

    <p class="indent15">
      Churchill Chutes,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      An&rsquo; the smartest set they had there was

    <p class="indent20">
      a-wearin&rsquo; spike-sole boots.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Excuse us for the mention, but we feel com-
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      pelled to say,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &rsquo;Tisn&rsquo;t fair to shift a fashion all a sudden, this
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &rsquo;ere way;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      An&rsquo; the local delegation, when it came with the
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      in-vite,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Omitted partunt leathers in its mention of to-
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      night.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      So I guess ye&rsquo;ll have to take us with these
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      spikes upon our soles,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      We can&rsquo;t appear in stockin&rsquo;s,&rsquo;cause the most of
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      us have holes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      But the genial floor director guarded still the
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      outer door
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And declared that &ldquo;gents with spikers weren&rsquo;t
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      allowed upon the floor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      He said&rsquo;twas very awkward that special guests
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      should thus
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Be kept in outer darkness, and he didn&rsquo;t want a
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      fuss.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      But so long as Rapogenusites had issued their
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      decree
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      He hadn&rsquo;t any option, &ldquo;as a gent with sense
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      could see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      So he passed his ultimatum, &ldquo;Ye must shed
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      them spike-sole boots!
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      For we hain&rsquo;t the sort of humstrums that ye&rsquo;ll
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      find at Churchill Chutes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Then up spoke Smoky Finnegan, the boss of
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Murphy&rsquo;s crew,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Said he, &ldquo;The push at Churchill sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t be
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      slurred by such as you.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      We&rsquo;re gents that&rsquo;s very gentle an&rsquo; we never
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      make a fuss,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      But in slurrin&rsquo; folks at Churchill ye are also
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      slurrin&rsquo; us.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      We have interduced the fashions up at Church-
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      ill quite a while,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      An&rsquo; no Rapo-genus half-breeds have the right
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      to trig our style.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      If ye&rsquo;ve dropped the vogue of spikers at the
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      present Christmas ball
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      We will start the fashion over, good and solid,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      that is all!
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      So, mister, please excuse us, but ye&rsquo;ll open up
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      your sluice,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Or God have mercy on ye if I turn these gents
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      here loose!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Then the genial floor director shouted back
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      within the room,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;Ho, men of Rapo-genus, here is trouble at
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      the boom!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      But even as he shouted, with a rush and crush
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      and roar,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Like a bursting jam of timber Murphy&rsquo;s angels
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      stormed the door.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Then against them rose the sawyers of the
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Rapo-genus mill,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Who rallied for the conflict with a most in-
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      trepid will,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      But by new decree of fashion they were wear-
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      ing boughten suits
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And even all the boomsmen had put off their
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      spike-sole boots.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      So that gallant crew of Murphy&rsquo;s simply trod
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      upon their feet,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And backward, howling, cursing, they com-
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      pelled them to retreat.

      The people who were standing at the walls in

      pocket-boom.

      All the matrons and the maidens were as

    <p class="indent15">
      And one by one the women were escorted from

      the trap,

      And without a word of protest, as they drifted

    <p class="indent20">
      slowly through,

    <p class="indent15">
      They paid their tolls in kisses to the men of

    <p class="indent20">
      without success,

      They were herded down the middle of the

      They were yarded at the river; Murphy&rsquo;s pea-

    <p class="indent15">
      Though the men of Rapo-genus couldn&rsquo;t smash

    <p class="indent20">
      that human vise

    <p class="indent15">
      When the water touched their toes,

    <p class="indent15">
      Then at last they fought like demons for to
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      save their boughten clothes.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      But as fierce were Murphy&rsquo;s hearties, and their
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      spikers helped them win,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      For they kicked and spurred their victims and
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      they dragged them shrieking in.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Then with water to their shoulders there they

      And at midnight&rsquo;twas decided by a universal

    <p class="indent15">

      Denied all hope of ford.

    <p class="indent15">
      So I clutched at the face of the dripping ledge

    <p class="indent15">
      And crouched from the lashing rain,

    <p class="indent15">
      While the thunderous sound of the tumult

      Its iron into my brain.

    <p class="indent15">
      Through whorls of the rolling mists,

    <p class="indent15">

    <p class="indent15">
      Out of the spume and fogs

    <p class="indent15">
      A chap drove through&mdash;one o&rsquo; Connor&rsquo;s crew&mdash;

      He was holding his pick-pole couched at Death

      If this be sacrilege, pardon me, pray;

      Serenely cool to the foam-flecked pool

      Now just for a moment I&rsquo;ll let the machine,

    <p class="indent15">
      Grind lyrical praise of the base nicotine.

      &mdash;An ode of a sort of a commonplace stripe

    <p class="indent15">

      Have you found in the woods that a fragrant

    <p class="indent20">
      cigar
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Tastes worse than an elm-root slopped over

    <p class="indent20">
      with tar?
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Queer thing, that, my friend, but it&rsquo;s none the

      less true,

    <p class="indent15">
      &mdash;This quirk of tobacco&mdash;I&rsquo;ll leave it to you!

    <p class="indent20">
      cob,

    <p class="indent15">
      In the depths of the forest afar from the mob;

    <p class="indent15">
      And an incense that&rsquo;s sweet to ecstatic degree

    <p class="indent15">
      Curls up from the bowl of the ancient T. D.

    <p class="indent15">

      But ah, gentle fisher, the woods shout to thee,

    <p class="indent15">
      With fervent request that you bring the T. D.

    <p class="indent20">
      doors.

    <p class="indent15">
      Leave there city manners, creased trousers,

    <p class="indent20">
      your &ldquo;job,&rdquo;

      the sky.

      And they said in deepest gloom,

      on one log,

    <p class="indent15">
      And he shot the Big Seboomook at a mighty

      He reached Megantic Landing where he nim-

    <p class="indent20">
      the engineer.

    <p class="indent15">
      Of course he was arrested when the steamer

    <p class="indent20">
      got to shore;

    <p class="indent15">
      A justice fined O&rsquo;Connor and he paid the fine

    <p class="indent20">
      He had drawn his season&rsquo;s pay,

    <p class="indent20">

      clemency to pray.

    <p class="indent20">
      The drive was safely down,

    <p class="indent20">
      He was on his way to town;

    <p class="indent15">
      He was doing up the section and proposed to

    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      O&rsquo;Connor owned the railroad, as O&rsquo;Connor&rsquo;d

    <p class="indent20">
      chaffed and quaffed and laughed.

    <p class="indent15">
      He smashed the plate-glass windows, for he

    <p class="indent20">
      didn&rsquo;t like the styles.

    <p class="indent15">
      He smashed and promptly settled for a dozen
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      stove-pipe tiles;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      They took him into limbo right and left along
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      the line,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      He pulled his roll and willingly kept peeling off
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      his fine.
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      With his portly wad of pay
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      He paved his genial way,

    <p class="indent15">
      He&rsquo;d had no chance to spend it on the far-off
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Brass-u-a.
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      But now the drive was in,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      As he&rsquo;d neither kith nor kin,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      There seemed no special reason why he

    <p class="indent20">

    <p class="indent15">
      O&rsquo;Connor reached the city and he reached it

    <p class="indent20">
      with a jar,

      rung in three alarms,

      He had spent his last lone copper, but they sold

      Now Bill was a quitter, and therefore one day
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Those notes became due and his dad had to pay.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      So he slapped on a mortgage and then buckled
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      down
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      To pay up the int&rsquo;rest and keep off the town.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Oh, that mortgage, it clung like a sheep-tick in
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      wool,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And the more she sagged back, harder Ozy
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      would pull;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      But a mortgage can tucker the likeliest man,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And Ozy he found himself flat on hard pan.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      He dumped in his stock and his grain and his
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      hay,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      He scrimped and he skived and endeavored to
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      pay;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      He sold off his hay and his grain and his stock
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Till the ricky-tick-tack of the auctioneer&rsquo;s knock
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Kept up such a rapping on Ozy&rsquo;s old farm
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      That the auctioneer nigh had a kink in his
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      arm&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And it happened at last,&rsquo;long o&rsquo; Thanksgiving
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      time,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Old Ozy was stripped to his very last dime.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And he said to his helpmeet: &ldquo;Poor mummy,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      I van
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      I guess them &rsquo;ere critters have got all they can.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      For they&rsquo;ve sued off the stock till the barns
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      are all bare,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &rsquo;Cept the old turkey-gobbler, a-peckin&rsquo; out
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      there;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      They&rsquo;d&rsquo;a&rsquo; lifted him, too, for those lawyers are
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      rough,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      But they reckoned that gobbler was rather too
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      tough.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      So they&rsquo;ve left us our dinner for Thanksgivin&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Day;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Just remember that, mummy, to-night when
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      you pray.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Now chirk up your appetite, for, with God&rsquo;s
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      grace,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      We&rsquo;ll eat all at once all the stock on the place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      But Ozy he was a cheerful man,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      A goodly man, a godly man&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      He didn&rsquo;t repine at Heaven&rsquo;s plan, but he took
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      things as they came;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And cheerfully soon he whistled his tune
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      That he always whistled&mdash; &rsquo;twas Old Zip
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Coon,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And he whistled it all the afternoon with never
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      a word of blame.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      While all unaware of his owner&rsquo;s care,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      The gobbler pecked in the sunshine there,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      With a tip-toe, tip-toe Nancy air, and ruffled
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      like dancing dame;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Till it seemed to Ozy, whistling still
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      To the ripity-rap of the turkey&rsquo;s bill,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      That the prim old gobbler was keeping time
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      To the sweep and the swing of the wordless
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      rhyme:
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Pickety-peck,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      With arching neck,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      The turkey strutted with bow and beck.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And a Yankee notion was thereby born
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      To Ozy Orr ere another morn.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      A practical fellow was Ozy B. Orr,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      As keen an old Yankee as ever you saw
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      A bit of a platform he made out of tin,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      With a chance for a kerosene lantern within;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      He took his old fiddle and rosined the bow
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And took the old turkey&mdash;and there was his
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      show!
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      You don&rsquo;t understand? Well, I&rsquo;ll own up to
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      you
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      The crowds that he gathered were mystified,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      too.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      For he advertised there on his banner unfurled

    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;A Jig-dancing Turkey&mdash;Sole one in the
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      World.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And the more the folks saw it, the more and
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      the more
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      They flocked with their dimes, and jammed
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      at the door;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      For it really did seem that precocious old bird
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      At sound of the fiddle was wondrously stirred.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      In stateliest fashion the dance would commence,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Then faster and faster, with fervor intense,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Until, at the end, with a shriek of the strings
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And a furious gobble and whirlwind of wings,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      The turkey would side-step and two-step and
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      spin,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Then larrup with ardor that echoing tin.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And widely renowned, and regarded with awe,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Was the &ldquo;Great Dancing Turkey of Ozy B.

      &ldquo;S&rsquo;pose I&rsquo;ve got to if ye say so,&rdquo; says he scorn-

    <p class="indent20">
      hard as he could whale.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Ev&rsquo;ry time he reached and raked him on that

    <p class="indent20">
      bare white back of his&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Ow! them claws they grabbed in dretful and
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      they hurt him&mdash;ah, gee whiz!
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      There were howls and yowls and spittin&rsquo;s; it
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      was rip and slit and tear,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And the air was full of tom-cat and of flyin&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      skin and hair.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Final clip that Ezry hit him it was such a

    <p class="indent20">
      tarnal clout
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      That the cat he stuck on solid till they pried

      his toe-nails out.

    <p class="indent20">
      &ldquo;Scratch&rdquo; and &ldquo;Uncle Scratch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Since the time he cut that ding-do in a certain

      wrasslin&rsquo; match;

    <p class="indent15">

    <p class="indent20">
      Grouty and gruff,

    <p class="indent20">
      Profane and rough,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Old&rsquo;Lish Henderson slammed through life;
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Swore at his workers,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      &mdash;Both honest and shirkers,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Threatened his children and raved at his wife.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Yes,&rsquo;Lish was a waspish and churlish old man,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Who was certainly built on a porcupine plan,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      In all of the section there couldn&rsquo;t be found
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      A neighbor whom Henderson hadn&rsquo;t &ldquo;stood &lsquo;round.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And the men that he hired surveyed him with
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      awe
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And cowered whenever he flourished his jaw.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Till it came to the time that he hired John Gile,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      A brawny six-footer from Prince Edward&rsquo;s
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Isle.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      He wanted a teamster, old Henderson did,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And a number of candidates offered a bid,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      But his puffy red face and the glare in his eyes,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And his thunderous tones and his ominous size
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And the wealth of his language embarrassed
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      them so
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Their fright made them foolish;&mdash;he told them
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      to go.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And then, gaunt and shambling, with good-
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      natured smile,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Came bashfully forward the giant John Gile.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;Have ye ever driv&rsquo; oxen?&rdquo; old Henderson
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      roared.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Gile said he could tell the brad-end of a goad.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Then Henderson grinned at the crowd stand-
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      ing&rsquo;round
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And he dropped to his hands and his knees on
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      the ground.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;Here, fellow,&rdquo; he bellowed, &ldquo;you take that
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &rsquo;ere gad,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Just imagine I&rsquo;m oxen; now drive me, my
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      lad.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Just give me some samples of handlin&rsquo; the stick,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      I can tell if I want ye and tell ye blame quick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Gile fingered the goad hesitatingly, then
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      As he saw Uncle&rsquo;Lish grinning up at the men
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Who were eyeing the trial, said, &ldquo;Mister, I
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      swan,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &lsquo;Tain&rsquo;t fair on a feller&mdash;this teamin&rsquo; a man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m oxen&mdash;I&rsquo;m oxen,&rdquo; old Henderson cried,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;Git onto your job or git out an&rsquo; go hide.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Then Gile held the goad-stick in uncertain pose
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And gingerly swished it near Uncle&rsquo;Lish&rsquo;s
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      nose.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;Wo hysh,&rdquo; he said gently; &ldquo;gee up, there,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      old Bright!
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Wo hysh&mdash;wo, wo, hysh,&rdquo;&mdash;but with mischiev-
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      ous light
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      In his beady old eyes Uncle&rsquo;Lish never stirred
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And the language he used was the worst ever
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      heard.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;Why, drat ye,&rdquo; he roared &ldquo;hain&rsquo;t ye got no
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      more sprawl
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Than a five year old girl? Why, ye might as
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      well call
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Your team &lsquo;Mister Oxen,&rsquo; and say to &rsquo;em,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      &lsquo;please!&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And then Uncle&rsquo;Lish settled down on his
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      knees.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And he snapped, &ldquo;Hain&rsquo;t ye grit enough, man,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      to say scat?
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Ye&rsquo;ll never git anywhere, drivin&rsquo; like that.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      I&rsquo;ll tell ye right now that the oxen I own
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Hain&rsquo;t driven like kittens; they don&rsquo;t go alone,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      There&rsquo;s pepper-sass in &rsquo;em&mdash;they&rsquo;re r&rsquo;arin&rsquo; an&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      hot, .
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      An&rsquo; I&mdash;I&rsquo;m the r&rsquo;arin&rsquo;est ox in the lot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Then Uncle&rsquo;Lish Henderson lowered his head
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And bellowed and snorted. John Gile calmly
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      said,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;Of course&mdash;oh, of course in a case such as
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      that&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      He threw out his quid and he threw down his
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      hat,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Jumped up, cracked his heels, danced around
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Uncle&rsquo;Lish
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And yelled like a maniac, &ldquo;Blast ye, wo hysh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Ere Uncle&rsquo;Lish Henderson knew what was
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      what
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      His teeth fairly chattered, he got such a swat
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      From that vicious ash stick&mdash;though that
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      wasn&rsquo;t as bad
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      As when the man gave him two inches of brad,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &mdash;Just jabbed it with all of his two-handed
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      might,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;Wo, haw, there,&rdquo; he shouted, &ldquo;gee up there,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      old Bright!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Well, Uncle&rsquo;Lish gee-ed&mdash;there&rsquo;s no doubt
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      about that&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Went into the air and he squalled like a cat,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Made a swing and a swoop at that man in a
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      style
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      That would show he proposed to annihilate
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Gile.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      But Gile clinched the goad-stick and hit him a
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      whack
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      On the bridge of his nose&mdash;sent him staggering
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      back,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And he reeled and he gasped and he sunk on
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      his knee,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;Dad-rat ye,&rdquo; yelled Gile, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t ye try to
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      hook me!
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Gee up, there&mdash;go&rsquo;long there; wo haw an&rsquo; wo
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      hysh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And again did he bury that brad in old&rsquo;Lish,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Then he lammed and he basted him, steady and
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      hard,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      He chased and he bradded him all&rsquo;round the
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      yard,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Till&rsquo;Lish fairly screamed, as he dodged like a

    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;For heaven&rsquo;s sake, stranger, let&rsquo;s play I hain&rsquo;t

    <p class="indent20">
      ox.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Gile bashfully stammered, &ldquo;Why,&rsquo;course ye

    <p class="indent20">
      are not!

    <p class="indent15">
      But ye&rsquo;ll have to excuse me&mdash;I sort o&rsquo; forgot!&rdquo;

    <p class="indent20">
      With a twisted smile

    <p class="indent20">
      &lsquo;Lish looked at Gile,

    <p class="indent15">
      Then he lifted one hand from the place where

    <p class="indent20">
      he smarted;

      Right plumb up against him that city chap

      A chap that&rsquo;s so mad that his face is pea green.

      right,

    <p class="indent15">
      While the feller was still scoring down in a

      With his mouth propped apart; oh, he&rsquo;d plenty

      to say,

    <p class="indent20">
      through!

    <p class="indent15">
      Says he, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been sorry I sold you that hoss

      And whenever you&rsquo;d see in a faint-hearted

      crowd,

    <p class="indent15">
      A man who was hollerin&rsquo; &rsquo;specially loud,

      You could calculate suttin that positive man

    <p class="indent15">

    <p class="indent15">
      For after a while all the folks stood in awe

    <p class="indent15">
      Of the roar of his voice and the build of his

    <p class="indent20">
      jaw;

    <p class="indent15">
      He was lookin&rsquo; for trouble and carried a chip

    <p class="indent15">
      And chance for a tussle he never let slip;

    <p class="indent15">
      He hated to think that the world could still go

    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;whoa!&rdquo;

    <p class="indent15">
      One day he was teamin&rsquo; his oxen to town;

    <p class="indent20">
      down.

    <p class="indent15">

      &mdash;Pokin&rsquo; out o&rsquo; his way for the sake of a

    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Whenever he noticed a boulder or stump

    <p class="indent15">
      He&rsquo;d gee. and ride over the critter ker-bump!

    <p class="indent15">
      But it happened one boulder that he came

    <p class="indent20">
      across
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Gave Benjamin&rsquo;s ox-cart too lively a toss;

      He was under the broad-tired wheels, s&rsquo;r. before

    <p class="indent15">
      He&rsquo;d gathered his voice for his usual roar.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      But just as the ox-cart rolled over him&mdash;oh,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      You&rsquo;d a-fallen down stunned at the way he
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      yelled &ldquo;whoa!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &rsquo;Twas so loud and so threat&rsquo;nin&rsquo; that Brindle

      Were so eager to stop that they backed, s&rsquo;r,

      The wheel it rolled over the old man again.

      There&rsquo;s a moral to this as you notice, no doubt,

      I&rsquo;ll say to reformers and dogmatists, though,

      The lids of mourning eyes were raised and

    <p class="indent15">

    <p class="indent15">
      An old-fashioned calf-skin as black as your hat;

    <p class="indent20">
      much.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      He noticed a crowd&rsquo;round a pleasant-faced

    <p class="indent15">
      Whose business seemed based on a curious plan;

    <p class="indent20">
      lowed

      That simply to advertise he would restore

      more.

    <p class="indent15">
      Now Abbott B. Appleton he did invest&mdash;

    <p class="indent15">
      Informed him it didn&rsquo;t work always the same,

    <p class="indent15">

      Then Abbott, in order to make himself square,

    <p class="indent15">

      brain,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      From thinking on what mother wrote from up

    <p class="indent15">
      All through the day he dictates brisk replies,

    <p class="indent15">
      The penmanship is rounded, schoolboy style,

    <p class="indent15">
      Without, the summer silence lies&mdash;

    <p class="indent15">
      Within, the meeting-house is still;

    <p class="indent15">
      The hush of First Day hovers o&rsquo;er

    <p class="indent15">
      All human-kind on Quaker Hill.

    <p class="indent15">
      The tethered Dobbins doze and blink
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      In stolid calm beneath the shed;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      In First Day, Quaker attitude,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      With half-closed eyes and drooping head.

    <p class="indent15">
      The cheeping birds, abashed and mute,

    <p class="indent15">
      Have skittered off to search for shade.

      Just one lone roysterer, a bee,

    <p class="indent15">
      Whirrs up against a staring pane

    <p class="indent15">
      And folds his wings and sits him down,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      To gaze with apiarian mirth
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      On strange drab poke and shining crown.

    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      The elders sit in sober rows,

    <p class="indent15">
      Upon the long, prim, facing-seats;

    <p class="indent15">
      &mdash;Each visage like an iron mask;

    <p class="indent15">
      No look of recognition greets

    <p class="indent15">
      Their half-veiled gaze droops coldly down,

    <p class="indent15">
      Unnoting that the gracious Lord

    <p class="indent15">
      The Spirit has not moved the tongue;

      And in the hush of silent prayer,

    <p class="indent15">
      Each worshipper has bent alone.

      And some are sad and some are stern

      And some are smug and others bow

      As though, with furtive stealth, to hide

      And he who&rsquo;s sitting at the head

    <p class="indent15">
      Breaks on the hush with reverent tone:
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;If friends,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;have planned to wed

    <p class="indent15">
      &rsquo;Tis meet that now they do proceed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Forthwith upon the women&rsquo;s side
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      A blushing youth stands forth in view
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And with him shrinks his Quaker bride.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      With trembling hand in shaking palm,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      They face the Meeting&rsquo;s awful hush,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &mdash;No minister to question them,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      No kindly shield to hide a blush.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Alone they stand, alone must they
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Swear matrimony&rsquo;s solemn oath;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      A hundred noses point their way,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Two hundred eyes stare hard at both.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Then twice and thrice the youth&rsquo;s parched lips
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Strive hard to frame the longed-for word;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And twice and thrice he tries again,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Yet not a single sound is heard.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      There&rsquo;s just an upward flash of eyes
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Like starlight in a forest pool,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &mdash;She may have said, &ldquo;Take heart, dear
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      one!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &mdash;She may have said, &ldquo;Go on, thou fool!

    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      His cheeks flush dark, his lips are gray,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      His knees drum fast against the pew.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      But by a mighty gasp he speaks,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      The dry lips part, a croak comes through:
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;Here in the presence of the Lord,

    <p class="indent15">
      And in the First-Day meeting, I
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Take thee, my friend, Susannah Saul

    <p class="indent15">
      To be my wife. My loving eye
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Shall rest on thee, and till the Lord
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Is pleased by death to separate
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Our lives and loves, I&rsquo;ll be to thee
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      An honest, faithful, loving mate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      As one an echo of a song
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Thrums thinly on a single string,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      The Quaker maid in trembling tones
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Vows to her lord to likewise bring
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Love, truth and trust to grace their home.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Their voices cease and side by side
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      They stand abashed. One honest voice
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Rolls out, &ldquo;Amen;&rdquo; the knot is tied.

      THE MADAWASKA WOOING
    </h2>
    <p class="indent15">
      Petit Pierre of Attegat,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &mdash;Peter, the Little, round and fat,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Balanced himself on the edge of a chair
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And gazed in the eyes of Father Claire.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Without on the porch, defiant sat
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      The prettiest maiden in Attegat.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And here was trouble; for Zelia Dionne
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Had vowed to the Virgin she&rsquo;d be a nun;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      But Peter, who loved her more than life,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Was fully as bound she should be his wife.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Yet as often as Peter pressed to wed
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      The pretty Zelia tossed her head.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not for the wife of man,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve dreamed three times our Mary came
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And pressed my brow and spoke my name.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      I know she means for me to kneel
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And take the vows at St. Basil.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Though Peter stormed, yet Zelia clung
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      To her belief and braved his tongue.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;Je t&rsquo;aime, mon cher,&rdquo; she shyly said,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And drooped her eyes and bent her head;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;But when our Virgin Mother calls
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      A maiden to her convent walls,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      How shameless she to disobey
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And follow her own guilty way!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;But dearest,&rdquo; Peter warmly plead,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;&rsquo;Twould not be guilty if it led
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      To our own home and our own love!
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Our Holy Mother from Above,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Will pardon us&mdash;I know she will&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And yet the maid responded still,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;I dare not, Peter, disobey,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And follow my own guilty way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      So thus it chanced that Zelia Dionne
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Had vowed herself to be a nun.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Though Peter teased for many a day
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      She pressed her lips and said him nay,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And when he begged that she at least
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Would leave the question to the priest,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Although she grudged her faint consent
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      As meaning doubt, at last she went,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Overpersuaded by Peter&rsquo;s prayer,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      To take the case to Father Clair.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Peter, the Little, of Attegat
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Fumbled with trembling hands his hat,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      As breathlessly he tried to trace
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      The thoughts that crossed the father&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;My son,&rdquo; at length the priest returned,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &mdash;How Peter&rsquo;s heart within him burned&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;If truly by the maid the Queen
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Of Most High Heaven hath been seen,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &mdash;If only in her maiden dreams&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      You must allow it ill beseems
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      My mouth to speak. It may be sin,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      For&mdash;well, my son, bring Zelia in!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      She stood before him half abashed
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Yet boldly, too;&mdash;her dark cheek dashed
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      With ruddy flame; for all her soul
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Burned holily. For now her whole
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Rich nature stirred. She was not awed
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      For had she not been called of God?
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And little Peter sat and stared
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And marvelled how he&rsquo;d ever dared
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      To lift his eyes to such a maid,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Or strive to wreck the choice she&rsquo;d made.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      She told in simple terms the tale.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;And do you wish to take the veil?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      The father asked. &ldquo;Think long, think twice
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And never mourn the sacrifice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      She quivered, but she said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve thought;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Our Mary wills it and I ought.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;And can you gladly say farewell
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      To earth and love and friends; to dwell
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      With perfect peace nor ever sigh
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      For things behind?&rdquo; She said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <p class="indent15">
      The old time love for Peter stirred;

    <p class="indent15">
      And mingling with her quick regret,

    <p class="indent15">
      There came a sob and Peter&rsquo;s wet,

    <p class="indent15">
      Sad eyes peered at her through a rain

    <p class="indent15">

    <p class="indent15">
      She flung herself upon his breast.

    <p class="indent15">
      A moment thus&mdash;and then in prayer

      &ldquo;My daughter, did that vision speak

      She pressed her hand upon thy brow?

      No? Then, my child, she spoke just now;

    <p class="indent15">
      And in the promptings of thy heart

    <p class="indent15">
      Her word is clear. My child, thou art

    <p class="indent15">
      Blest in this choice, for that caress

      Peter, the Little, of Attegat,

    <p class="indent15">

      And the hoof of the blue-blood horse!

    <p class="indent15">
      The song of the long, bright sword;

    <p class="indent15">
      The chant of the weapon the patriot draws

    </h2>
    <p class="indent15">
      There was Sinon, he of Troy, and Ulysses, too,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      and Cain,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Who preceded many centuries the liars here in
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Maine.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      There was Gulliver, Munchausen, there was
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Ananias, too,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      A very handsome job of it those gentlemen
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      could do.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Yet look at Ananias! Why, his story knocked
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      him dead,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      But here in Maine the liar &ldquo;does&rdquo; the other
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      man instead.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And Sinon, he of Troy, had to plan and build
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      his lie,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      But here in Maine the liar doesn&rsquo;t even have
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      to try.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      For the pure prevarication comes cascading
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      down his lip
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And he never seems to falter or to stub his toe
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      and trip.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And he walks abroad with honor, and no mortal
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      will arraign
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      The pure and worthy motives of the liar here
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      in Maine.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      His strongest hold is fishing, and he fixes with
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      his eye
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      The victim who must listen and who never
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      dares deny.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Each river and pellucid pond, each brooklet and
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      each stream,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Possesses fifty liars to preserve it in esteem.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And he that owns a yaller dog, and he that
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      owns a hoss
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Will never see their laurels dimmed, if words
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      can add a gloss.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &rsquo;Tis true the old inhabitant, narrating ancient

    <p class="indent20">
      tales,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Occasionally soars to heights where homely
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      language fails.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      So then, alas, he&rsquo;s hampered some, but note
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      his kindling eye,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And as he gets his second wind, observe how
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      he can lie!
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &rsquo;Tis no invidious charge I bring against this
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      worthy crew,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      We love the lies they tell to us and love the

      THE BALLAD OF HUNNEMAN TWO
    </h2>
    <p class="indent15">
      Now this is the story of Hunneman Two,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Old Hunneman Two from Andover town;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &mdash;A tub with the likeliest, heftiest crew
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      That ever hoorayed in a hot break-&rsquo;er-down.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And I&rsquo;ll give you the facts, for if any one knows
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      It&rsquo;s me who was Hunneman&rsquo;s foreman of hose:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Ev&rsquo;ry feller we mustered was over six feet
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And the gang that we brought to a fireman&rsquo;s
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      meet
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      They never was licked and they never was
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      downed,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And a crowd up against us would likely get
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      drowned.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Ev&rsquo;ry man in the forty was six feet and more
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And their shirts was the reddest that ever men
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      wore;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Whenever they hollered they&rsquo;d jump up a yard
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And when they came down they came dreffully
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      hard.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Ev&rsquo;ry man had a trumpet and some of them
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      tew
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &mdash;And&rsquo;twas safest to plug up your ears when
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      they blew.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      They&rsquo;d ballast the tub with a cart-load of stone
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And stuff her with sody ontil she would groan
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Then they&rsquo;d spit on their fists and would gaffle
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      that beam
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And whoop fa, la larry, my jinks what a
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      stream!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &rsquo;Twas h&rsquo;ist on the beam till your eyeballs gog-

    <p class="indent30">
      Pump-jump-hump!
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Down with the beam till it sartin would seem
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      We were drowndin&rsquo; the sun in a hissin&rsquo;, white
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      stream.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Oh, there never was anything up with the crew
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      That buckled the beam of old Hunneman Two.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      One time we were playin&rsquo; at Andover fair
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And old Uncle Boomer drove up with his mare.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      She cocked up an eye for to see the stream sail
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Then she up with her ears and her head and
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      her tail;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And whoosh! she was off down the Bunganuck
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      road
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      At as lively a clip as a mare ever hoed.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Now the Bunganuck road it was right straight
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      away,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And jest for a hector we started to play
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Right over the tailboard, right into his team,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And we followed him up with old Hunneman&rsquo;s
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      stream.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      We followed him one mile, we followed him
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      tew
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      With the foreman a-swearin&rsquo; and all of the
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      crew
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      A-breakin&rsquo; her down and a-crackin&rsquo; their heels
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Till we lifted her plum fair and square off the
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      wheels.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      We followed him three miles, we followed him
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      four
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &mdash;If he hadn&rsquo;t shied off we&rsquo;d a-followed him
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      more.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Old Boomer got rheumatiz out of wet feet
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      For we kept his old waggin full, clear to the

      TRIBUTE TO MR. ATKINS&rsquo;S BASS VOICE

    <p class="indent15">
      E. Perley Atkins had a low&mdash;deep&mdash;bass.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      The noise came out of his face,

    <p class="indent15">
      But the place

    <p class="indent15">
      Whence the sound sprung
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And bubbled toward the bung,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      When he sung,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      To come lolloping up to his tongue,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      In long fortissimo hoots,

    <p class="indent15">
      Or staccato toots,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &mdash;That place was suttin&rsquo;ly down in his boots.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Omp, omp!

    <p class="indent15">
      That was the kind of a bass
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      That oozed from the face
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Of E. Perley Atkins who lived in our place.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      He sung at all the paring bees, the quilting teas,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      and parti-ees
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      He sung at all the shindigees we had for miles
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      around.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      He opened his lip and let her rip and folks were
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      never obliged to tease,
    </p>
    <p class="indent30">
      For he allowed

      That he was proud

    <p class="indent15">
      As well as the rest of the awe-struck crowd

    <p class="indent15">
      Ready to omp, omp night or day.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      He sung in the choir Sunday forenoon
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And an hour later furnished a tune
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      For the Sabbath school and the Bible class,

    <p class="indent15">
      With a voice that was meller&rsquo;n apple sass.

    <p class="indent15">
      At evenin&rsquo; meetin&rsquo; he came around

    <p class="indent15">
      Full to the neck with that cream-rich sound,

    <p class="indent15">
      Would lift ye off&rsquo;n your pew, by Jim.

    <p class="indent15">
      On Monday nights he had a call

      To sing for the Maltys at Jackson&rsquo;s Hall.

    <p class="indent15">
      Tuesdays the Masons and Wednesdays he

    <p class="indent15">
      Sung like blazes for the I. G. T.

    <p class="indent15">
      Thursdays, class-meetings, Fridays, sings
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      With Saturdays open for rackets and things.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      A busy week? Well, I guess, but wait,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      I mustn&rsquo;t forget, my friend, to state
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      There warn&rsquo;t no fun&rsquo;ral for ten miles&rsquo;round,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      No dear departed tucked under ground,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      No mourners jammed in a settin&rsquo; room,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Sozzled in grief and soaked in gloom,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      But Perley was there with his rich, cream bass
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      To trickle like salve on the wounded place.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And the tears would dry on each mourner&rsquo;s
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      nose,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      They&rsquo;d perk right up and forget their woes
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And nudge each other and say, &ldquo;Suz me,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      What a beautiful funeral voice that be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And in time, though he sang for all who asked,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      For saint and sinner, still he basked
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      In especial favor as one whose ease
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">

    <p class="indent15">
      Real impish constructions to jig on a line

    <p class="indent15">
      That was jerked by a water-wheel down in the

      brook;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      All the horses that passed, if they got a good

      Tumbled down stiff and dead or else, frantic
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      with fear,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Kicked the wagon in bits and spun&rsquo;round on
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      one ear.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And he rigged a contrivance by which ev&rsquo;ry

    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Stepped down on a lever that flipped up a lock
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And down came the fodder in front of the
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      stock.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Still, these were but puerile notions beside
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      The thing that he hoped for&mdash;his spur and his
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      pride,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      His climax of schemes ere he went back to
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      dust&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      For he vowed that he&rsquo;d fathom the secret or
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      &ldquo;bust;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      That if motion perpetual ever could be
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Discovered by mortal, that man should be he.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      So he fussed with his springs and his wee-jees
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      and wings
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And all sorts of queer little duflicker things,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And he builded queer whiz-a-jigs, then with a
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      frown
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      He ruthlessly, scornfully cuffed them all down.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Well, the years hurried by, as the years surely
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      will,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      But Eliphalet Jones he was confident still,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      For he constantly vowed that some thingumy
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      spring
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Put somewhere &ldquo;would settle the dad-ratted
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Yet the years skittered past and his head was
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      snow-white
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And he almost had solved it, but never &ldquo;jest
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      quite;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      So the neighbors employed some satirical tones
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      When they chanced to refer to Perpetual Jones.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      But hail to his name and remember his fame!
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      At the last&mdash;at the last, friends, he won the
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      great game!
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      He died at the birth of his triumph,&rsquo;tis true,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And he left only words&mdash;yet I give them to
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      you,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Convinced they&rsquo;re a gift to the world, without
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      doubt,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Or will be as soon as the thing is worked out.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      He sat in his chair by the window one day
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      While his grandson was out with a puppy at
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      play;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And the boy hitched some meat to the tail of
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      that pup,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Then he gave him a twirl and the puppy &ldquo;gee-
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      ed up,&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And he spun and he spun and he spun and he
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      spun
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Just as fast at the last as when he begun,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      But the tail and the meat ever kept just ahead
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Of the clamorous jaws as the puppy dog sped.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;There she is,&rdquo; cried Eliphalet, &ldquo;darned if she
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      ain&rsquo;t!
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      There&rsquo;s perpetual motion!&rdquo; and pallid and faint
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      He fell prone and dying. They lifted him up
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And his eyes, glazed with death, looked their
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      last on that pup.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And through the dark shade of mortality&rsquo;s fog
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      He gasped, &ldquo;All you need is the right kind of
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      dog.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Inventor Jones&mdash;Eliphalet Jones,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Ah, he was the fellow for schemes;

    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      stones

    <p class="indent15">
      Our town set it down
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      As a fact beyond disputing there was never
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      any suiting
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Like the suiting that was made by Spinster

      Brown.

    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      She raised the wool she made it of, she even
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      raised the sheep,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      She fed &rsquo;em on the toughest straw the hired
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      man could reap
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      She spun the thread with double-twist and
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      made a warp and woof
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      So tarnal tough it really seemed&rsquo;twas almost
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      bullet-proof.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And when the cloth was shrunk and dyed and
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      ready for a suit
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      The men in town would almost fight, they&rsquo;d
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      get in such dispute
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Concerning who had spoken first&mdash;the farthest
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      in advance&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And therefore had the prior claim on Aunt
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Jemimy&rsquo;s pants.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      The cloth that folks make nowadays is slimpsy,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      sleazy stuff;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      It&rsquo;s colored up in fairish style and fashionable
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      enough!
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      But blame the goods! It&rsquo;s made to sell&mdash;it
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      isn&rsquo;t made to wear&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      These trousers here I&rsquo;ve worn five year, and
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      that is merely fair.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      But when you bought a cut of cloth of Aunt
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Jemimy&rsquo;s weave,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      You got some stuff to last you through, you&rsquo;d
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      better just believe!
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Why, &rsquo;bout the time that modern pants are get-
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      ting worn and thin
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      A pair of Aunt Jemimy&rsquo;s pants were scarcely
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      broken in.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      I&rsquo;ve got a pair up attic now, made forty years
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      ago
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      They&rsquo;re just as tough as iron still and Time
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      has made no show.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      They&rsquo;ve stood the brunt of honest work and
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      dulled the tooth of moth,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And there they stand, as stiff&rsquo;s a slab, good,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      plain, old-fashioned cloth.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And so I think it&rsquo;s only right that tribute
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      should be paid
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      To those old sturdy pioneers&mdash;the pants Je-
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      mimy made.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      The day I first put on those pants I held a
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      break-up plough&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      The farmers of these later days don&rsquo;t have
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      such wrassles now;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      I drove six oxen on ahead, a pretty hefty team,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      For farming in those old, old days took mus-
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      cle, grit and steam;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      You didn&rsquo;t stop for rocks and stumps, nor
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      dodge and skive and skip,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Or else you&rsquo;d have to lug your meals on ev&rsquo;ry
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      furrow&rsquo;s trip,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And so the only thing to do was make the oxen
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      tread
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And hold the ploughshare deep and true, and
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      plunk &rsquo;er straight ahead.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      So back and forth and back and forth I
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      ploughed and ploughed that day;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      I tackled ev&rsquo;ry rock and snag that dared dispute
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      my way,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Until the only critter left was one old maple
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      stump,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And I?&mdash;I gave the team the gad&mdash;and took
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      &rsquo;er on the jump!
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      She split in halves and through I went, but
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      back she slapped, ker-whack,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And gripped Jemimy&rsquo;s pantaloons right where
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      she&rsquo;d left the slack.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      The team was going double-quick&mdash;the oxen
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      plunged along&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      I held the old oak handle-bars, I gripped &rsquo;em
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      good and strong&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And there I was, the living link&rsquo;twixt stump
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      and plough, because
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      The cloth it stuck there good and tight between
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      those maple jaws.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Jemimy never planned on that, in making pants
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      for me;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      She made &rsquo;em solid, yet of course she gave no
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      guarantee
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      That they would stand a yank like that&mdash;but
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      still I clung and yelled,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Those oxen plunged and tussled and&mdash;Je-
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      mimy&rsquo;s pants, they held!
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And the stump came out a-kicking, roots and
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      dirt and stones and all,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      But those pants weren&rsquo;t even started by that
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      most tremendous haul,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And to prove this &rsquo;ere is truthful, should some
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      scoffer cast a doubt,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      I have saved the chips and hewings where they

    <p class="indent15">

    <p class="indent15">
      &mdash;In a shed out back they smoked their hams.

    <p class="indent15">
      And old Elkanah used to brag

    <p class="indent15">
      They laid down pickles by the kag;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And they had the darndest hens to lay

    <p class="indent15">

      For he used to say what made meat tough
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Was &rsquo;cause some cooks warn&rsquo;t strong enough.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And he piled the grub right on sky-high:

    <p class="indent15">
      Soup and meat and fish and pie

    <p class="indent15">
      &mdash;All the courses on first whack&mdash;

    <p class="indent15">

    <p class="indent15">
      And say: &ldquo;There, people, now hoe in;

    <p class="indent15">

    <p class="indent15">
      And kept the office fire bright.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      He nodded some and yawned and smoked,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And at half-past three he went and poked
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      The kitchen fire; then pounded steak
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And set potatoes in to bake.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Started the coffee and all the rest
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And then went up to call his guest.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Bangity, whang! on the cracked old door!

    <p class="indent15">
      Whangity, bang! It checked a snore.

    <p class="indent15">
      P. Mortimer Perkins opened his eyes
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      In the cold dark dawn with much surprise,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And under the coverlet warm and thick
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      On the good, old-fashioned feather tick,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Felt the cold on his nose like a frosty knife
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And was never so sleepy in all his life.

    <p class="indent15">
      But still bang, whang on the cracked old door!
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And Elkanah shouting, &ldquo;Mos&rsquo; ha&rsquo;f-pas&rsquo; four!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      But the louder the old man pounded and yapped
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      The more the drummer garped and gapped.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      At last says he: &ldquo;Is it stormy&mdash;oh-h-h?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;Wall,&rdquo; says Elkanah, &ldquo;she&rsquo;s spittin&rsquo; snow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      P. Mortimer Perkins snuggled down

      And says he, &ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t a blamed bad town;

    <p class="indent15">
      I say, old man, now please go&rsquo;way,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      I&rsquo;ve changed my mind, and I guess I&rsquo;ll stay.&rdquo;

      Elkanah B. Atkinson then says he:

      &ldquo;This changin&rsquo; minds is a bad idee;

    <p class="indent15">

    <p class="indent15">
      Now, friend, ye can go on that train or not,

    <p class="indent15">
      But I tell ye now, right off- the reel,

    <p class="indent15">
      But Elkanah slammed right through that door,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And he pulled that drummer out of bed
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And brandished a chair&rsquo;round over his head;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      He poked his ribs and made him dress

    <p class="indent15">
      So sleepy still that his gait cut S

    <p class="indent15">
      As he staggered down to the dining-room

    <p class="indent15">
      And ate his meal in the cheerless gloom,

    <p class="indent15">

    <p class="indent15">
      With a stick and a steaming coffee can.

    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;Now, mister,&rdquo; allowed Elkanah, &ldquo;sence

      It&rsquo;s a special breakfus&rsquo; it&rsquo;s thutty cents.&rdquo;
     </p>

      When the feller paid, as meek&rsquo;s a pup,

      BALLAD OF OBADI FRYE
    </h2>
    <p class="indent15">
      &rsquo;Twas a battered old, double-B, twisted bass
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      horn,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      With a yaw in the flare at its end;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      A left-over veteran, relic forlorn
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Of the halcyon days when a band had been
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      born
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      To the village of Buckleby Bend.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      The band was dismembered by time and by
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      death
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      As the years went a-scurrying by,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And only one player was left with his breath
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      And that was old Obadi&rsquo; I.
    </p>
    <p class="indent30">
      P. Frye.

    <p class="indent20">
      Old Obadi&rsquo; Isaac Pitt Frye.

    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      With a glow in his eye
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      He would plaintively try
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      To puff out the tune that they marched to at
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      training;
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      But the tremolo drone
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Of the brassy old tone
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Quavered queerly enough with his scant breath
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      remaining.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Ah, the years had been many and bent was his
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      back,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And caved was his chest and departed his
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      knack;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      So, though he was filled with musicianly pride
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And huffed at the mouthpiece and earnestly
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      tried
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      To steady his palsied old lip and control
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      The old-fashioned harmonies stirring his soul&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      There was nothing in Buckleby quite so for-
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      lorn
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      As the oomp-tooty-oomp of that old bass horn.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      To the parties and sociables, quiltings and sings
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      They invited old Obadi&rsquo; Frye;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      He&rsquo;d give &rsquo;em doldrums of old-fashioned
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      things
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      With occasional bass obligato for strings
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      &mdash;Or at least he would zealously try.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      The minister coaxed him to buy a cornet
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      And chirk up a bit in his tune,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      But none could induce him to ever forget
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      His love for that old bassoon,
    </p>
    <p class="indent30">
      Whose tune
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Was the solace of life&rsquo;s afternoon.
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      So he&rsquo;d splutter and moan
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      With his thin, gusty tone
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      But his empty old lungs balked his anxious en-
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      deavor.
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      He hadn&rsquo;t the starch
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      For a jig or a march,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And with double-F volume he&rsquo;d parted forever.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      For he hadn&rsquo;t the breath for a triple note run,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &rsquo;Twas a whoof and a pouf! and alas, he was
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      done;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      But the pride of his heart was that old double-
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      bass,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      He was happy alone with its lips at his face.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      So he sat in his old leather chair day by day
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And whooped the one solo he&rsquo;d power to play,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      An anthem entitled, &ldquo;All Hail Christmas
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Morn,&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      As rendered by gulps on an old bass horn.

    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      With a sort of a farewell purr;

    <p class="indent15">
      Of course there are many to scoff and to scout,

    <p class="indent15">

    <p class="indent20">
      out doubt,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      At least, so the neighbors aver.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      They laid him away in the churchyard to rest
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And with grief that they sought not to hide,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      They placed the old battered B-B on his breast
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And that Christmas hymn score by his side&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent30">
      His pride,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">

    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      So they rose on Tuesday evening, at Friday
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      meeting, too,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And informed their friends and neighbors what
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      the sinners ought to do;

    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      They explained the route to Heaven and ex-
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      horted all to go
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      In the straight and narrow pathway through
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      the blandishments below;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      They were good and they were earnest, but,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      alas, a little tame,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      For month by month and year by year their
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      talks were just the same,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Until the folks who&rsquo;d listened all those many
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      years could start
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And declaim those exhortations, for they had
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      &rsquo;em all by heart.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And those old folks talked so constant there
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      was scarcely time to sing,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      For they just let in regardless and monopolized
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      the thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Now, benign old Parson Johnson died at last.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      There&rsquo;s scarcely doubt
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      That those prosy dissertations sort of wore
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      the old man out.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And he promptly was succeeded ere the church
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      had dried its tears
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      By a cocky, youthful pastor, who was full of
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      new ideas.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Now, he sized the situation ere he&rsquo;d been in
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      town a week,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And he set to work to fix it by a plan that was
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      unique,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      For he saw unless he did so&mdash;and the Lord
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      allowed them breath,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Those devoted saints would surely talk that
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      wearied church to death.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      So he came to Tuesday meeting and upon his
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      desk he placed
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      A nickeled teacher&rsquo;s call-bell and blandly then
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      he faced
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      An astonished congregation and explained he
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      thought it best
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      To condense the exhortations so as not to
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      crowd the rest;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      For he said that in the worship all the members
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      ought to share,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And monopoly of talking by the elders wasn&rsquo;t
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      fair;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Therefore, each could have five minutes, and
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      he&rsquo;d ring to let each know
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      When &rsquo;twas time to cut the discourse and give
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      t&rsquo;other one a show.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      There were scowls from Uncle Ezry&mdash;there
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      were grunts from Uncle Goff,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And Deacon Simon Peaslee gave a scornful
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      vestry cough.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Then he laid his cane beside him and he strug-
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      gled to his feet
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And commenced his regular discourse in re-
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      gard to tares and wheat.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      He was scarcely fairly going on the punish-
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      ments of hell
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      When the pastor smiled and nodded and ding-
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      clink-ling went the bell!
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      All the old folks gasped in horror and a titter
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      soft and low
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Ran along the youthful sinners who were back
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      on Devil&rsquo;s Row;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And for just a thrilling instant Deacon Simon
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      lost his force,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      With astonished jaws a-gaping&mdash;then continued
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      on his course.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      To the pastor&rsquo;s youthful visage swept a sudden
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      flush of wrath,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      As the obstinate old deacon brushed him calmly
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      from his path,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And with all the college muscle that he had at
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      his command
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      The parson cuffed the call-bell with a swift
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      and steady hand.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      There was riot in the vestry&mdash;deacon vieing
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      with the bell,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      As he strove to paint the terrors of the hot,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      John Wesley hell,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Till at last he balked and stuttered, gasped a
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      while and tried to speak,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Then sat down with tears a-dropping through
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      the furrows on his cheek.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      There he bent in voiceless anguish with his old
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      gray head bowed low,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      While the hushed and pitying people mourned
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      to see him grieving so;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And the parson left the platform and contritely
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      crept across
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      To the side of Deacon Simon and expressed his
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      deep remorse.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      But the deacon raised his visage, and, with tears
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      still streaming down,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Glared upon his trembling pastor with a fierce
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      and scornful frown.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;Drat yer hide,&rdquo; roared Deacon Simon, &ldquo;do
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      ye think that leetle bell
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Scart a warrior sech as I am out of talking
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      truths on hell?
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t no passon sets me down, sah! &rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t

    <p class="indent20">
      no bell ye ever saw,

    <p class="indent15">
      But ye went and got me narvous and ye&rsquo;ve

     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Then the deacon, stern and angry, arm in arm
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      with Jonas Goff,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And with Uncle Cyphers trailing, stalked in
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      righteous dudgeon off,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And the sympathizing parish held a meeting
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      there and then,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And extolled the absent deacon as the most
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      abused of men;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And the parson&rsquo;s walking papers hit his neck
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      below the jaw
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      In about the same location that the deacon lost

      &mdash;We sort of got the notion he was &ldquo;It&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      and we tagged gool,

    <p class="indent15">
      We gave him lots of jolly in a free and easy

    <p class="indent20">
      way,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">

    <p class="indent15">
      We showed him where the other one had torn

      away the door

    <p class="indent15">
      When we lugged him out and dumped him in

    <p class="indent20">
      the snow the year before.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And soon&rsquo;s we thought we&rsquo;d scared him, we sat
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      and chawed and spit,

    <p class="indent15">
      And kind o&rsquo; thought we&rsquo;d run the school&mdash;con-

    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      It worked along in that way, sir, till Friday

    <p class="indent20">
      afternoon.

    <p class="indent15">
      &mdash;We hadn&rsquo;t lugged him out that week, but

    <p class="indent20">
      &rsquo;lowed to do it soon.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      That Friday,&rsquo;long about three o&rsquo;clock, he said
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      there&rsquo;d be recess,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And said, &ldquo;The smaller kids and girls can go

    <p class="indent20">
      for good, I guess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And he mentioned smooth and smily, but with
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      kind of greenish eyes,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      That the big boys were requested to remain

    </p>
    <p class="indent15">

    <p class="indent15">

    <p class="indent20">
      speech,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &mdash;Then he made a pass at Haskell, who was

    <p class="indent20">
      nearest one in reach.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &rsquo;Twas hot and stiff and sudden and it took him
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      on the jaw,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And that was all the exercise the Haskell feller

      saw.

    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Then jumpin&rsquo; over Haskell&rsquo;s seat, he sauntered

      up the aisle,

    <p class="indent15">
      A-hittin&rsquo; right and hittin&rsquo; left and wearin&rsquo; that

    <p class="indent15">
      And when a feller started up and tried to hit

    <p class="indent15">

    <p class="indent20">
      rushed by twos and threes,

    <p class="indent15">
      He simply strolled around that room and licked

      us all with ease.

    <p class="indent15">
      And when the thing was nicely done, he

      dumped us in the yard,

    <p class="indent20">
      the day;

    <p class="indent15">
      And they perched along the fences while the

      Came trailin&rsquo; through the village with the old

      It wasn&rsquo;t just &ldquo;stupendous,&rdquo; but the people

    <p class="indent20">
      last year!

    <p class="indent15">
      O, no, they crunched their peanuts and they

    <p class="indent20">
      took things as they&rsquo;d come,

    <p class="indent15">
      And heard a lot of music in the rump-rump of
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      the drum.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      For things, you know, seemed fresher in the
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      days when we were young,

    <p class="indent15">
      And tinsel passed for solid stuff when lady

    <p class="indent20">
      riders sprung
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Through papered hoops, or danced and frisked
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      upon their charger&rsquo;s rump

    <p class="indent15">

    <p class="indent15">
      I won&rsquo;t pick flaws with modern ways of doing

    <p class="indent20">
      all these things,

      And life that&rsquo;s lived at three ring pace I fear

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
